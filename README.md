## School-Work
A collection of intriguing programs that I have completed both during school and outside the classroom.


# FBLA-library:
  I was charged with creating a computer system that could track instinces of books and studnets in a school Library. I would need to have ways to track specific books, track the students and teachers that have checked out the books, and also have a report on overdue books.
