# Coding Examples
A collection of intriguing programs that I have completed both during school and outside the classroom.


## FBLA-library:
I was charged with creating a computer system that could track instances of books and students in a school Library. I would need to have ways to track specific books, track the students and teachers that have checked out the books, and also have a report on overdue books. I did this in Python, utilizing Python's dictionary instinct and the class system. I also include the library "time" to track how long a book has been checked out for. This was for the Future Business Leaders of America, Coding and Programming, competition. I got first in districts, third in state and attended nationals.

## ‘War-games’
For my final in CSCI 1300 class, I was charged with using everything that we learned to create a project. I decided to create a video game with the classic board game Risk in mind. I used a multidimensional array and various classes to control a ‘board’ of sorts. I also included a simple AI that controls the computer players in the game. The ‘battles’ between armies were a probability based simulation. Finally I had a save game and load game function.

## Cars
Using R-Studio I read in a database of cars on a car search website. Based on certain characteristics of the cars I would plot various graphs, including a line of best fit. I would then find the car farthest below that line in order to find the best deal for the two variables being listed.
